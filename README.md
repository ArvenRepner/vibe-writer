# vibe-writer
A simple, no-frills, no-distractions writing app to help keep your thoughts organized as you write.
To launch, either use in the browser via GitHub Pages, or download all three files, put them in the same folder, and open the main HTML file in your browser of choice. 

This is my first experiment with vibe coding, done in Google Gemini

There are three modes. Each mode saves content independently inside your browser's local storage, and has its own sidebar. Here, you can create tabs and fill each tab with notes. You can use this to organize sources for journalistic articles, keep characters and magic systems organized for a fantasy tale, or keep software references at hand when writing technical documentation, to name just a few potential use cases. 

You'll notice there's also a Dark Mode toggle. In Light Mode, you can pick from a few accent colors. 

More features to come as I think of them and find ways to implement them. 

Let me know if anything breaks. 

If you feel so inclined, donations are welcome
